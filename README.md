# Wowhead news RSS filter

[Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/) does provide [RSS](https://www.wowhead.com/news) feed for its [news](https://www.wowhead.com/news) section, but it doesn't provide any way of filtering categories.
This REST API wraps Wowhead's RSS, but allows for filtering out categories.

The API is created with `Python3.11` and [`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
